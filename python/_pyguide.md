Project Guidelines
------------------

### Version ###

**Decision**: Use Python 2.7.

**Pros**: Stable syntax and feature set, high avalability, no issues with
packages incompatibility, some of the new features from the 3.x line can be
imported selectively from the _[futures](builtin-futures)_ module or via
backported and 3rd party packages, e.g. _[concurrent.futures](concurrent-futures)_
and _[future]_.

**Cons**: Some runtime, syntax and standard library improvements from the
3.x line aren't available, if the 2.x line will ever become deprecated the code
will need to be ported to the new version, although automated tools can help
mitigating the problem, e.g. _[2to3]_ and _[futurize]_.

Language Guidelines
-------------------

### Lint ###

**Decision**: Make sure you run _[pylint]_ on your code, suppress warnings if
they are inappropriate so that other issues are not hidden.

To suppress warnings, you can set a line-level comment:

```python
dict = 'something awful'  # Bad Idea... pylint: disable=redefined-builtin
```

_[pylint]_ warnings are each identified by a alphanumeric code (C0112) and a
symbolic name (empty-docstring). Prefer the symbolic names in new code or when
updating existing code; if the reason for the suppression is not clear from the
symbolic name, add an explanation, uppressing in this way has the advantage
that we can easily search for suppressions and revisit them.

You can get a list of pylint warnings by doing `pylint --list-msgs`. To get
more information on a particular message, use `pylint --help-msg=C6409`.

Prefer `pylint: disable` to the deprecated older form `pylint: disable-msg`.

Unused argument warnings can be suppressed by using `_` as the identifier for
the unused argument or prefixing the argument name with `unused_`.
In situations where changing the argument names is infeasible, you can mention
them at the beginning of the function. For example:

```python
def foo(a, unused_b, unused_c, d=None, e=None):
    _ = d, e
    return a
```

**Pros**: Catches easy-to-miss errors like typos, using-vars-before-assignment,
etc.

**Cons**: _[pylint]_ isn't perfect, to take advantage of it we'll need
to sometimes:

- Write around it
- Suppress its warnings or
- Improve it

[pylint]: http://www.pylint.org


### Imports ###

**Decision**:

- Use `import x` for importing packages and modules
- Use `from x import y` where _x_ is the package prefix and _y_ is the module
  name with no prefix
- use `from x import y as z` if two modules named _y_ are to be imported or if
  _y_ is an inconveniently long name.

For example the module `sound.effects.echo` may be imported as follows:

```python
from sound.effects import echo
# ...
echo.EchoFilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)
```

Do not use relative names in imports; even if the module is in the same
package, use the full package name. This helps prevent unintentionally
importing a package twice.

**Pros**: The namespace management convention is simple. The source of each
identifier is indicated in a consistent way; `x.Obj` says that object _Obj_ is
defined in module _x_.

**Cons**: Module names can still collide, some module names are
inconveniently long.


### Packages ###

**Decision**: All new code should import each module by its full package name,
imports should be as follows:

```python
# Reference in code with complete name.
import sound.effects.echo

# Reference in code with just module name (preferred).
from sound.effects import echo
```

**Pros**: Avoids conflicts in module names, makes it easier to find modules.

**Cons**: Makes it harder to deploy code because you have to replicate the
package hierarchy.


### Exceptions ###

**Decision**: Exceptions must follow certain conditions:

- Raise exceptions as `raise MyException('Error message')` or
  `raise MyException`, do not use the two-argument form
  `(raise MyException, 'Error message')` or deprecated string-based exceptions
  `(raise 'Error message')`
- Modules or packages should define their own domain-specific base exception
  class, which should inherit from the built-in `Exception` class. The base
  exception for a module should be called _Error_

```python
class Error(Exception):
    pass
```

- Never use `catch-all except:` statements or
  `catch Exception or StandardError` unless you are re-raising the exception or
  in the outermost block in your thread (and printing an error message); Python
  is very tolerant in this regard and `except:` will really catch everything
  including misspelled names, `sys.exit()` calls, _Ctrl+C_ interrupts, unittest
  failures and all kinds of other exceptions that you simply don't want to
  catch
- Minimize the amount of code in a try/except block; the larger the body of the
  try, the more likely that an exception will be raised by a line of code that
  you didn't expect to raise an exception. In those cases, the try/except block
  hides a real error
- Use the finally clause to execute code whether or not an exception is raised
  in the try block; this is often useful for cleanup, i.e. closing a file
- When capturing an exception, use as rather than a comma; for example:

```python
try:
    raise Error
except Error as error:
    pass
```

**Pros**: The control flow of normal operation code is not cluttered by
error-handling code; it also allows the control flow to skip multiple frames
when a certain condition occurs, e.g. returning from N nested functions in one
step instead of having to carry-through error codes.

**Cons**: May cause the control flow to be confusing. Easy to miss error cases
when making library calls.


### Global Variables ###

**Decision**: Avoid global variables in favor of class variables,
some exceptions are:

- Default options for scripts
- Module-level constants, e.g. `PI = 3.14159`; constants should be named using
  all caps with underscores, see _[Naming]_ below
- It is sometimes useful for globals to cache values needed or returned by
  functions
- If needed, globals should be made internal to the module and accessed through
  public module level functions, see _[Naming]_ below

**Pros**: Occasionally useful.

**Cons**: Has the potential to change module behavior during the import,
because assignments to module-level variables are done when the module
is imported.

[naming]: #naming


### Local Classes and Functions ###

**Decision**: A class can be defined inside of a method/function/class,
a function can be defined inside a method or function, nested functions have
read-only access to variables defined in enclosing scopes.

**Pros**: Allows definition of utility classes and functions that are only used
inside of a very limited scope.

**Cons**: Instances of nested or local classes cannot be pickled.


### List Comprehensions ###

**Decision**: Okay to use for simple cases, each portion must fit on one line
(mapping expression, for clause, filter expression); multiple for clauses or
filter expressions are not permitted, use loops instead when things get more
complicated.

```python
# Yes

result = []
for x in range(10):
    for y in range(5):
        if x * y > 10:
            result.append((x, y))

for x in xrange(5):
    for y in xrange(5):
        if x != y:
            for z in xrange(5):
                if y != z:
                    yield (x, y, z)

return ((x, complicated_transform(x))
    for x in long_generator_function(parameter)
        if x is not None)

squares = [x * x for x in range(10)]

eat(jelly_bean for jelly_bean in jelly_beans if jelly_bean.color == 'black')

# No

result = [(x, y) for x in range(10) for y in range(5) if x * y > 10]

return ((x, y, z)
    for x in xrange(5)
    for y in xrange(5)
    if x != y
    for z in xrange(5)
    if y != z)
```

**Pros**: Simple list comprehensions can be clearer and simpler than other list
creation techniques; generator expressions can be very efficient, since they
avoid the creation of a list entirely.

**Cons**: Complicated list comprehensions or generator expressions can be hard
to read.


### Default Iterators and Operators ###

**Decision**: Use default iterators and operators for types that support them,
like lists, dictionaries, and files; The built-in types define iterator
methods too, prefer these methods to methods that return lists, except that you
should not mutate a container while iterating over it.

```python
# Yes

for key in adict:
    pass

if key not in adict:
    pass

if obj in alist:
    pass

for line in afile:
    pass

for k, v in dict.iteritems():
    pass

# No

for key in adict.keys():
    pass

if not adict.has_key(key):
    pass

for line in afile.readlines():
    pass
```

**Pros**: The default iterators and operators are simple and efficient, they
express the operation directly, without extra method calls. A function that
uses default operators is generic, it can be used with any type that supports
the operation.

**Cons**: You can't tell the type of objects by reading the method names
(e.g. `has_key()` means a dictionary), this is also an advantage.


### Generators ###

**Decision**: Use whenever appropriate, the doc strings for generator functions
sould include `Yields:` rather than `Returns:`.

**Pros**: Simpler code, because the state of local variables and control flow
are preserved for each call, generators also use less memory than functions
creating an entire list of values at once.

**Cons**: None.


### Lambda Functions ###

**Decision**: Use _lambda functions_ only for one-liners but if the code inside
function is any longer than 60–80 chars, then it's probably better to define
it as a regular (nested) function.

For common operations like multiplication, use the functions from the
_operator module_ instead of _lambda functions_, e.g. prefer `operator.mul` to
`lambda x, y: x * y`.

**Pros**: Convenient.

**Cons**: Harder to read and debug than local functions; the lack of names
means stack traces are more difficult to understand, expressiveness is also
limited because the function may only contain an expression.


### Conditional Expressions ###

**Decision**: Use only for one-liners, in other cases prefer to use a complete
_if statement_.

**Pros**: Shorter and more convenient than an _if statement_.

**Cons**: May be harder to read than an _if statement_, the condition may be
difficult to locate if the expression is long.


### Default Argument Values ###

**Decision**: Okay to use with the exception of mutable objects as default
values in the function or method definition.

```python
# Yes

def foo(a, b=None):
    if b is None:
        b = []

# No

def foo(a, b=[]):
    pass

def foo(a, b=time.time()): # The time the module was loaded???
    pass

def foo(a, b=FLAGS.my_thing): # sys.argv has not yet been parsed...
    pass
```

**Pros**: Often you have a function that uses lots of default values,
but—rarely—you want to override the defaults. Default argument values provide an
easy way to do this, without having to define lots of functions for the rare
exceptions. Also, Python does not support overloaded methods/functions and
default arguments are an easy way of "faking" the overloading behavior.

**Cons**: Default arguments are evaluated once at module load time. This may
cause problems if the argument is a mutable object such as a list or a
dictionary. If the function modifies the object (e.g., by appending an item to a
list), the default value is modified.


### Properties ###

**Decision**: Use properties to access or set data instead of accessor or setter
methods; read-only properties should be created with the `@property` decorator.

Inheritance with properties can be non-obvious if the property itself is not
overridden, thus one must make sure that accessor methods are called indirectly
to ensure methods overridden in subclasses are called by the property (using the
Template Method DP).

```python
# Yes

import math

class Square(object):
    """A square with two properties: a writable area and a read-only perimeter.

    To use:
    >>> sq = Square(3)
    >>> sq.area
    9
    >>> sq.perimeter
    12
    >>> sq.area = 16
    >>> sq.side
    4
    >>> sq.perimeter
    16
    """

    def __init__(self, side):
        self.side = side

    def __get_area(self):
        """Calculates the 'area' property."""
        return self.side ** 2

    def ___get_area(self):
        """Indirect accessor for 'area' property."""
        return self.__get_area()

    def __set_area(self, area):
        """Sets the 'area' property."""
        self.side = math.sqrt(area)

    def ___set_area(self, area):
        """Indirect setter for 'area' property."""
        self.__set_area(area)

    area = property(___get_area, ___set_area,
                    doc="""Gets or sets the area of the square.""")

    @property
    def perimeter(self):
        return self.side * 4
```

**Pros**: Properties are considered the pythonic way to maintain the interface
of a class allowing accessor methods to be added in the future without breaking
the interface increasing readability. In terms of performance, allowing
properties bypasses needing trivial accessor methods when a direct variable
access is reasonable and calculations can be delayed/made lazy.


**Cons**: Properties are specified after the getter and setter methods are
declared, requiring one to notice they are used for properties farther down in
the code (except for readonly properties created with the @property decorator),
and classes must inherit from object. This can also hide side-effects much like
operator overloading and could be confusing for subclasses.


### True and False Evaluations ###

**Decision**: Use the "implicit" false if at all possible, e.g. `if foo:`
rather than `if foo != []:`, there are a few caveats that you should keep in mind though:

- Never use `==` or `!=` to compare singletons like `None`, use `is` or
  `is not`
- Beware of writing `if x:` when you really mean `if x is not None:`, e.g. when
  testing whether a variable or argument that defaults to `None` was set to
  some other value; the other value might be a value that's false in a boolean
  context!
- Never compare a boolean variable to `False` using `==`, use `if not x:`
  instead; if you need to distinguish `False` from `None` then chain the
  expressions, such as `if not x and x is not None:`
- For sequences (strings, lists, tuples), use the fact that empty sequences are
  false, so `if not seq:` or `if seq:` is preferable to `if len(seq):` or
  `if not len(seq):`
- When handling integers, implicit false may involve more risk than benefit
  (i.e. accidentally handling `None` as `0`); you may compare a value which is
  known to be an integer (and is not the result of `len()`) against the integer
  `0`

```python
# Yes

if not users:
    print 'no users'

if foo == 0:
    self.handle_zero()

if i % 10 == 0:
    self.handle_multiple_of_ten()

# No

if len(users) == 0:
    print 'no users'

if foo is not None and not foo:
    self.handle_zero()

if not i % 10:
    self.handle_multiple_of_ten()
```

- Note that `'0'` (i.e., `0` as string) evaluates to true

**Pros**: Conditions using Python booleans are easier to read and less
error-prone, in most cases they're also faster.

**Cons**: May look strange to C/C++ developers.


### Deprecated Language Features ###

**Decision**:

- Use string methods instead of the `string` module where possible
- Use function call syntax instead of `apply`
- Use list comprehensions and for loops instead of `filter` and `map` when the
  function argument would have been an inlined lambda anyway
- Use for loops instead of `reduce`

```python
# Yes

words = foo.split(':')

[x[1] for x in my_list if x[2] == 5]

map(math.sqrt, data) # No inlined lambda expression

fn(*args, **kwargs)

# No

import string
words = string.split(foo, ':')

map(lambda x: x[1], filter(lambda x: x[2] == 5, my_list))

apply(fn, args, kwargs)
```

**Pros**: Cleaner, more readable code, in most cases faster.

**Cons**: We do not use any Python version which does not support these
features, so there is no reason not to use the new styles.


### Lexical Scoping ###

**Decision**: Okay to use, any assignment to a name in a block will cause
Python to treat all references to that name as a local variable, even if the
use precedes the assignment; if a global declaration occurs, the name is
treated as a global variable.

Try to avoid reusing names in both local and global scopes to avoid bugs:

```python
# Yes

def get_adder(summand1):
    """Returns a function that adds numbers to a given number."""

    def adder(summand2):
        return summand1 + summand2

    return adder

# No

i = 4 # i is global
def foo(x):
    def bar():
        print i, # No, wait... is local!

    # ...
    # A bunch of code here
    # ...
    for i in x:
        print i,

    bar()

# foo([1, 2, 3]) prints 1 2 3 3, not 1 2 3 4
```

**Pros**: Often results in clearer, more elegant code.

**Cons**: Can lead to confusing bugs (see example above), when used in local
functions that are returned could lead to references not being garbage
collected.


### Function and Method Decorators ###

**Decision**: Use decorators judiciously when there is a clear advantage;
decorators should follow the same import and naming guidelines as functions,
their pydoc string should clearly state that the function is a decorator and
they should be accompanied by unit tests.

Avoid external dependencies in the decorator itself (e.g. don't rely on files,
sockets, database connections, etc.) since they might not be available when the
decorator runs (at import time, perhaps from pydoc or other tools); a decorator
that is called with valid parameters should be guaranteed to succeed in all
cases.

Decorators are a special case of "top level code", see [main] for more discussion.

**Pros**: Elegantly specifies some transformation on a method; the
transformation might eliminate some repetitive code, enforce invariants, etc.

**Cons**: Decorators can perform arbitrary operations on a function's arguments
or return values, resulting in surprising implicit behavior; additionally,
decorators execute at import time, failures in decorator code are pretty much
impossible to recover from.


[main]: #main


### Threading ###

**Decision**: Don't rely on Python's built-in data types' atomic operations,
there are corner cases where they aren't atomic (e.g. if `__hash__` or
`__eq__` are implemented as Python methods) and their  atomicity should not be
relied upon, neither should you rely on atomic variable assignment (since this
in turn depends on dictionaries).

Use the `queue.Queue` data type as the preferred way
to communicate data between threads, otherwise use the `threading` module and
its locking primitives.

Learn about the proper use of condition variables so you can use
`threading.Condition` instead of using lower-level locks.

**Pros**: code that runs over multiple threads will be safer and more robust.

**Cons**: additional dependencies, more complicated syntax.


### Power Features ###

**Decision**: Avoid using features such as metaclasses, access to bytecode,
on-the-fly compilation, dynamic inheritance, object reparenting, import hacks,
reflection, modification of system internals, etc. in your code.

**Pros**: These are powerful language features which can make your code more
compact.

**Cons**: It's very tempting to use these "cool" features when they're not
absolutely necessary, they can make code that's using unusual features
underneath harder to read, understand, and debug; It doesn't seem that way at
first, but when revisiting the code it tends to be more difficult than code
that is longer but is straightforward.


Style Guidelines
----------------

### Semicolons ###

**Decision**: Do not terminate your lines with semi-colons and do not use
semi-colons to put two commands on the same line.


### Line length ###

**Decision**: Maximum line length is 80 characters, with two exceptions:

- Long import statements
- URLs in comments

Also do not use backslash line continuation but rather make use of Python's
implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and braces; if necessary,
you can add an extra pair of parentheses around an expression.

When a literal string won't fit on a single line, use parentheses for implicit
line joining.

Within comments, put long URLs on their own line if necessary.

See the [indentation] section for explanation of how to handle indenting line
continuations.

```python
# Yes

foo_bar(self, width, height, color='black', design=None, x='foo',
        emphasis=None, highlight=0)

if (width == 0 and height == 0 and
    color == 'red' and emphasis == 'strong'):

x = ('This will build a very long long '
     'long long long long long long string')

# See details at
# http://www.example.com/...long long URL.../specification.html

# No

if width == 0 and height == 0 and \
    color == 'red' and emphasis == 'strong':

x = 'This will build a very long long ' \
    'long long long long long long string'

# See details at
# http://www.example.com/us/developer/documentation/api/content/\
# v2.0/csv_file_name_extension_full_specification.html
```


[indentation]: #indentation


### Parentheses ###

**Decision**: Do not use them in return statements or conditional statements
unless using parentheses for implied line continuation (see [line length]),
it is however fine to use parentheses around tuples.

```python
# Yes

if foo:
    bar()

while x:
    x = bar()

if x and y:
    bar()

if not x:
    bar()

return foo

for (x, y) in dict.items():
    pass

# No

if (x):
    bar()

if not(x):
    bar()

return (foo)
```


[line length]: #line-length


### Indentation ###

**Decision**: Use 4 spaces to indent your code blocks, never use tabs or mix
tabs and spaces.

In cases of implied line continuation, you should align wrapped elements either
vertically (see the examples in the [line length] section) or using a hanging
indent of 4 spaces, in which case there should be no argument on the first line.

```python
# Yes

# Aligned with opening delimiter
foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
                         var_three, var_four)

# Aligned with opening delimiter in a dictionary
foo = {
    long_dictionary_key: value1 +
    value2,
    value3,
    value4
}

# 4-space hanging indent; nothing on first line
foo = long_function_name(
    var_one, var_two, var_three,
    var_four)

# 4-space hanging indent in a dictionary
foo = {
    long_dictionary_key:
        long_dictionary_value,
    long_dictionary_key2:
        long_dictionary_value2
}

# No

# Stuff on first line forbidden
foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
    var_three, var_four)

# 2-space hanging indent forbidden
foo = long_function_name(
  var_one, var_two, var_three,
  var_four)

# No hanging indent in a dictionary
foo = {
    long_dictionary_key:
        long_dictionary_value,
    long_dictionary_key2:
        long_dictionary_value2}
```
